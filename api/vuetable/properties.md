# Vuetable Properties

## api-mode

- **type:** `Boolean`

- **default:** `true`

- **usage:**

  By default, Vuetable will request the data from an API endpoint specified in `api-url`.

  However, you can instruct Vuetable to use your existing data instead by setting `api-mode` to `false` (also known as "**Data mode**"). Then, Vuetable will look for the data in the `data` prop.

  The data you supply to `data` prop must be of the JSON structure that Vuetable can work with. Please see [JSON Data Structure] for more detail.

  Please note that disabling `api-mode` (by setting it to `false`)
  will also **disable** all API related functionalities, like sorting, filtering, etc. But you can use `data-manager` prop to define the data manager function that can perform those functionalities to the data before Vuetable is using it.

  ::: tip Note
    Setting `api-mode` to `false` is not recommended. It will not scale well when you have to handle a large dataset   yourself instead of letting database manager at the backend handles it for you.

## api-url
- works in _API mode_ only
- **type:** `String`
- **default:** `''` _(empty string)_
- **usage:**

  The URL of the api endpoint that Vuetable will interact with.

  If the API supports sorting, filtering, pagination of the data,
  Vuetable can automatically append appropriate information to the server via query string.

  ::: tip Note
  Vuetable does not do sort or know how to sort your data. It is just a presentation layer of your data returned from the server side (API endpoint).

  In API mode, your API endpoint must be able to accept sort options; otherwise, the sorting will not work. Vuetable can send appropriate request with sort option when the user interacts with it. See [Sorting] for more detail.

  In Data mode, you, as a developer, are responsible for sorting the data using any mechanism of your choice and then supply that sorted data to Vuetable to display.

- works in _API mode_ only
- **type:** `Function`

  If `null`, Vuetable will fallback to using `axios` internally.

  If specified, Vuetable will call the given function passing `apiUrl` and already constructed `httpOptions` to the function.

  ::: warning
  Vuetable would expect the given function to make an AJAX call to the `apiUrl` with the `httpOptions` and return a [_Promise_](https://developer.mozilla.org/th/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global`Objects/Promise). Vuetable would then handle the success or failure of the AJAX call after the Promise has been resolved.
  :::

  See `loadData` and `fetch` methods in `Vuetable.vue` source code if you're confused.

  Here's an example using `vue-resource`
  ```js
    //...
    myFetch(apiUrl, httpOptions) {

    },
    //...

  to handle AJAX request.

## initial-page

## multi-sort
- works in _API mode_ only
- **type:** `Boolean`
- **default:** `false`
- **usage:**

  Enable multiple sort columns interaction.

  When this is enabled, user can press a modifier key (specified in `multi-sort-key` prop) to do subsequent sorting of the sort result.

  ::: tip Note
  In multi-sort mode, the sort icon in subsequent sort column will appear dimmer to indicate the level of sorting.

  The text to be used as keys in query string that will be sent to the server. If your API endpoint uses different keys, you can
  specified them via this prop.

  When you set `query-params` prop as a _Function`, you can completely override the behevior of `query-prams` prop on how the query string is constructed.

  Vuetable will pass the following parameters to the given function:
  - `sortOrder` -- the current sort order
  - `currentPage` -- the current display page
  - `perPage` -- the current page size

  The function must return an object containing key-value pair(s) to be constructed as query string; otherwise, and **empty object** `{}` will be returned instead.

- **usage:**

  The CSS class name that will be applied to each table row.

  If `row-class` prop is a _Function`, Vuetable will automatically call the given function on each row, passing the row data and row index to it. Vuetable will then use the returned string from the given method as CSS class for that row.

  Here is the example on using a method to return the row class for styling.
  ```vue
  <template>
    <vuetable
      :row-class="onRowClass"
    ></vuetable>
  </template>
  <script>
    //..
    methods: {
      onRowClass (dataItem, index) {
        return (dataItem.isOverdue) ? 'color-red' : 'color-white'
      }
    }
  </script>
  ```

## show-sort-icons
- **type:** `Boolean`
- **default:** `true`
- **usage:**

  This tells Vuetable whether or not icons should be added to `th` elements whenever a given column is sortable.

## sort-order
- works in _API mode_ only
- **type:** `Array`
- **default:** `[]` _(empty array)_

- **default:** `links.pagination`
- **usage:**

  The pagination path inside the data structure that contains the pagination information.

  If the your data from the server does not have pagination metadata, you should set the prop to empty string, e.g. `pagination-path=""`, to suppress warning from Vuetable.

## table-height
- **type:** `String`
- **default:** `null`
- **usage:**

  Fix the height of table body.

  When set, the height of the body of Vuetable will be set at the given value and vertical scrollbar will appear automatically when the content of table body is longer than the given value.

  The value can be any unit valid in HTML.

  ::: warning
  You must also set the width of each column in fields definition when you specify the height of table, otherwise, the width of the each column in the header and in the body will not look the same.

  Because Vuetable renders table header and table body as separate tables.
  :::

## track-by
- **type:** `String`
- **default:** `id`
- **usage:**

  The key that uses to unqiuely identified each row in the data array to help track the state of detail row and checkbox
  features of Vuetable. This is necessary for the detail row and checkbox features to function correctly.

  For detail row, whenever the user clicks to expand the detail row, Vuetable will insert the `id` of that row into
  its internal array (`visibleDetailRows`). And when that detail row is hidden, the `id` of that detail row is removed from
  the array.

  For checkbox, when the user selects (checked) a row, Vuetable will insert the `id` of the row into its internal
  array (`selectedTo`). And when that row is unselected (unchecked), the `id` of that row is removed from the array.

- See also:
  - [`visibleDetailRows`](./data.html#visibledetailrows)
  - [`selectedTo`](./data.html#selectedto)

## transform

- **usage:**

  A function that allows the user to programmatically transform the receiving data into the one can Vuetable can works with.

  When defined, the given function will be called whenever Vuetable recieves the requested data from the server, before the data are displayed. This provides a hook to manipulate the data that developer might have control over its format, transforming the data into the format that Vuetable can be used.

  The function will receive the raw data returned from the server as its parameter. It must returns the already transformed data; otherwise, the table might appear as empty.
